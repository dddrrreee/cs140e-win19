***NOTE: this class is being heavily reworked (pretty much strictly for the better).
I would recommend you use [the new version](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-20win)***

This is a lab-based class.  We will do two 3-hour labs each week.
You should be able to complete almost all of the lab in one sitting.

We try to work directly with primary-sources (mostly: the Broadcom manual
and the ARM6 manual, both in the `../docs` directory) since understanding
such prose is one of the main super-powers of good systems hackers.

Most the action happens in the [labs](labs/README.md) directory.  So go there!
